/**
 * Marks an abstract handler method.
 *
 * When there is a need to define an abstract base for a handler method, the base method must be
 * marked with `@ContractFor`. Such a base method is called a "contract method",
 * or simply a "contract". The `handler` type of the contract must match the type of
 * the handler method.
 *
 * In cases when there is a limitation on the allowed access modifiers for a handler method,
 * a method that inherits a contract may be declared `protected`.
 *
 * Example.
 * The abstract base that defines the contract method:
 * ```java
 *   public abstract class ProjectCreatedSubscriber extends AbstractEventSubscriber {
 *
 *       @ContractFor(handler = Subscribe.class)
 *       protected abstract void on(ProjectCreated event);
 *
 *       // Utility methods required by descendants.
 *       protected final UserId ownerFrom(Project project) { /* ... */ }
 *       protected final boolean isAdmin(UserId user) { /* ... */ }
 *   }
 * ```
 * The implementation:
 * ```java
 *   public final class LoggingSubscriber extends ProjectCreatedSubscriber {
 *
 *       @Subscribe
 *       protected void on(ProjectCreated event) {
 *           // ...
 *       }
 *   }
 * ```
 *
 * Note that the contract method serves only for convenience. It has no effect on signal processing.
 * There are no changes to the default signal dispatching either.
 * For example, commands can only have one handler method. Adding a contract method does not change
 * that. Yet, command handler methods can have contracts. For example, if the contract
 * is generalized, i.e. the method accepts an argument of a generic type, then
 * the contract implementations may accept different types of commands, while still maintaining
 * a shared portion of the contract. Consider the following example.
 * Here is an abstract commander definition:
 * ```
 *   abstract class SplittingCommander<C : CommandMessage> : AbstractCommander() {
 *
 *       @ContractFor(handler = Command::class)
 *       protected abstract fun on(cmd: C): Pair<FreezeProject, NotifyAdmin>;
 *   }
 * ```
 * And here are the implementations:
 * ```
 *   class PaymentSafety : SplittingCommander<InvalidatePaymentMethod> {
 *
 *       @Command
 *       protected fun on(cmd: InvalidatePaymentMethod): Pair<FreezeProject, NotifyAdmin> {
 *           // ...
 *       }
 *   }
 *
 *   // ...
 *
 *   class OrgCleansing : SplittingCommander<DivideOrganization> {
 *
 *       @Command
 *       protected fun on(cmd: DivideOrganization): Pair<FreezeProject, NotifyAdmin> {
 *           // ...
 *       }
 *   }
 * ```
 *
 * ## Motivation
 *
 * We need contract methods to enable creating small isolated "frameworks" based on Spine.
 * Such "frameworks" limit the possible usage of the general signal handling mechanism to
 * a predefined set of actions. For example, we would like to define a custom event reactor, which
 * only accepts one type of events (per reactor class) and produces some events as an output. We
 * create such a class, inheriting the standard framework reactor class and define a contract method
 * with the desired API. The users of the new class will quickly identify the need to implement
 * a method, without diving into the framework details.
 *
 * However, in order to support such hierarchies, we need to give some (but not all) handler
 * methods a higher degree of freedom. For instance, such methods need to be `protected`, which is
 * prohibited for most signal handlers. So, in order to discriminate contracts from general signal
 * handlers at runtime, we mark contracts with this annotation.
 *
